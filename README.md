Basic Meteor app with some practice working with a new technology for me, React!

https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/components


after getting meteor started,
run
meteor npm install --save react react-dom



To allow us to create a "data container" to feed Meteor's reactive data into React's component heierarchy:  
meteor npm install --save react-addons-pure-render-mixin
meteor add react-meteor-data
